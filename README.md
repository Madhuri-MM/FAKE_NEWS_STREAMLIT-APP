# FAKE_NEWS_STREAMLIT_APP
Fake News Detection is a machine learning model used to detect fake or real news.
This model is then deployed in streamlit.

# Libraries

Numpy,
Sk-learn,
Streamlit

# Streamlit
The streamlit library in Python to build an application for the machine learning model to detect fake news in real-time.

We can easily install it on our system using the pip command:

• pip install streamlit

We cannot run this code the same way we run our other Python programs. As we are using the streamlit library here, so we need to write a command mentioned below in our command prompt or terminal to run this code:

•	streamlit run filename.py

Once this command executes, it will open a link on our default web browser that will display our output as a web interface for fake news detection.
